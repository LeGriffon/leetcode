	 * How % and / works. These two operators can be helpful for matrix traversal
	 * problems. For a block traversal, it goes the following way. 0,0, 0,1, 0,2; <
	 * --- 3 Horizontal Steps followed by 1 Vertical step to next level. 1,0, 1,1,
	 * 1,2; < --- 3 Horizontal Steps followed by 1 Vertical step to next level. 2,0,
	 * 2,1, 2,2; < --- 3 Horizontal Steps. And so on...
	 * 
	 * But, the j iterates from 0 to 9. But we need to stop after 3 horizontal
	 * steps, and go down 1 step vertical. Use % for horizontal traversal. Because %
	 * increments by 1 for each j : 0%3 = 0 , 1%3 = 1, 2%3 = 2, and resets back. So
	 * this covers horizontal traversal for each block by 3 steps. Use / for
	 * vertical traversal. Because / increments by 1 after every 3 j: 0/3 = 0; 1/3 =
	 * 0; 2/3 =0; 3/3 = 1. So far, for a given block, you can traverse the whole
	 * block using just j. But because j is just 0 to 9, it will stay only first
	 * block. But to increment block, use i. To move horizontally to next block, use
	 * % again : ColIndex = 3 * i%3 (Multiply by 3 so that the next block is after 3
	 * columns. Ie 0,0 is start of first block, second block is 0,3 (not 0,1);
	 * Similarly, to move to next block vertically, use / and multiply by 3 as
	 * explained above.
